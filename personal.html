          This ranks among the top of my psychology/science books. James outlines what it truly means 
          to have a habit and why improving these habits can catapult our lives into something great.
          This book changed the way I see things just like "The Intelligent Investor"and "The Birth
          Order Book" did before it. Bravo!!!
